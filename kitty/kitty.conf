# --- Theme (pick one and comment the other) ---
# Use Kitty's themes kitten to install/apply:
#   kitty +kitten themes --reload-in=all "Monokai Pro"
#   kitty +kitten themes --reload-in=all "Monokai Pro (Light)"
# Or include a file directly once installed:
include ~/.config/kitty/themes/MonokaiPro.conf
# include ~/.config/kitty/themes/Monokai_Pro_Light.conf

# --- Window / titlebar ---
# Ghostty: macos-titlebar-style = "tabs"
# Kitty doesn't expose a "tabs titlebar" style, but:
macos_hide_titlebar yes           # hides traffic-light titlebar (macOS)
macos_titlebar_color system       # matches system (Light/Dark)
# tab_bar_style fade                # tab bar style (closest analog to a minimal look)

# Ghostty: gtk-titlebar-hide-when-maximized = true
# Not applicable in Kitty (handled by WM/desktop).

# --- Notifications ---
# Ghostty: app-notifications = false
# Kitty doesn't fire desktop notifications for bells; these mute terminal bells:
enable_audio_bell no
visual_bell_duration 0

# --- Startup window ----
# Ghostty: maximize = true
# Kitty has no "maximize", but you can fullscreen or let WM remember size:
# start_in_fullscreen yes
remember_window_size yes

# --- Cursor ---
# Ghostty: cursor-style = block / cursor-style-blink = false
cursor_shape block
cursor_blink_interval 0

# --- Keybindings ---

map shift+insert paste_from_clipboard
map ctrl+insert copy_to_clipboard

# --- Shell integration & SSH ---
# Ghostty: shell-integration-features = ssh-terminfo,ssh-env
# Recommended: use kitty's ssh kitten which forwards terminfo/env automatically:
#   kitty +kitten ssh your-host
# If you still want to preinstall terminfo on the remote:
#   infocmp -x xterm-kitty | ssh your-host -- tic -x -
allow_remote_control yes
listen_on unix:/tmp/kitty
# (enables some kittens/remote control features)
